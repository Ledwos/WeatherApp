# Weather App

## Description:

- As the name suggests, a simple weather app allowing one to view current weather in a location of their choosing.

- Originally an old repository with a dysfunctional app. The aim is to completely revamp this repository to show what I am capable  of using React for the frontend with a backend of my choosing.

## User Stories:

- Have an interface for me to enter the location for which I wish to see the weather

- See the weather results upon submitting my query

- Have an image associated with the location load along with my results

## Technologies Used:

- React
- HTML
- CSS
- Node
